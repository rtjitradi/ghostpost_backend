One model to represent both boasts and roasts
-Boolean to tell whether it's a boast or a roast
-CharField to put the content of the post in
-IntegerField for up votes
-IntegerField for down votes
-DateTimeField for submission time
Add a post deletion method that works for both boasts and roasts on the detail page. "Wait, how will we delete if it's anonymous?", I hear you ask. When a boast or a roast is created, it should have a random 6 character string associated with it (so that it's hard to guess). Every post now has two URLs... but one is public and one is private. For example, a valid post could have these two URLs:
localhost:8000/posts/1
localhost:8000/posts/abcdef
The one that ends in an ID should display a "public" version of the detail page; just the post itself. The one that ends in the "secret key" should be the same content, but with an additional button that allows you to delete the content. (Hint: have the button link to a different view that can delete a post by ID)
When the object is created, the magic string should be passed back to the front end in a link and given to the user; something like "Keep this link secure; this is your private link for managing this post!"
